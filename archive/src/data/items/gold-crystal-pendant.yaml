The gold mount displays fine granulation work with rows of tiny beads forming decorative borders, twisted wire ornamentation, and a suspension loop for wearing as a necklace pendant. Rock crystal was highly prized in antiquity for its clarity and was believed to possess protective and cooling properties. The sophisticated goldwork suggests manufacture in a major Hellenistic or Roman workshop."
