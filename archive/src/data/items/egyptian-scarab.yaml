description: "Blue-green glazed faience scarab amulet in the form of a dung beetle (Scarabaeus sacer). The dorsal side features detailed carving of the beetle's head, prothorax, and wing cases with incised line dividing the elytra. The flat base bears a hieroglyphic inscription reading 'Amun-Ra' (Imn-Rꜥ) - the king of the gods during the New Kingdom. The inscription shows the characteristic double plumes of Amun, a seated deity figure, and a was-scepter symbolizing divine power. Such Amun-Ra scarabs were popular protective amulets invoking the god's blessing and served as personal seals."
